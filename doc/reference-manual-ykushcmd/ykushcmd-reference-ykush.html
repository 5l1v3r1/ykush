<h2 id="command_overview">Command overview</h2>
<p>YKUSH board commands have the following structure.</p>
<p class="command_line">ykushcmd ykush [-s serial_number] [OPTION]</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<table>
        <tr>
                <td>-s serial_number</td>
                <td>
                        Board serial number to which the command is addressed.
                        When multiple YKUSH boards are connected to a host, this option should be used
                        to specify the board. If more than one board is connected and this option is not
                        provided the command will be sent to the first board in the USB enumeration list.
                </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>-d 1|2|3|a</td>
                <td>
                        Power Down/Off downstream port with the number provided.
                        If <i>a</i> is provided as the port number then all ports will be switched.
                </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>-u 1|2|3|a</td>
                <td>
                        Power Up/On downstream port with the number provided.
                        If <i>a</i> is provided as the port number then all ports will be switched.
                </td>
        </tr>
</table>



<h2 id="list_attached_example">List attached boards</h2>
<p>
        The <b>[-l]</b> option is used to list all attached YKUSH boards.
        All YKUSH board have unique serial numbers which are displayed when this option is used.
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-bash">
#list the serial number for each of the attached YKUSH boards
$ ykushcmd ykush -l

Attached YKUSH Boards:
1. Board found with serial number: YK17125
2. Board found with serial number: YK21493
</code>
</pre>
                


<h2 id="switch_command_example">Downstream port On/Off switching</h2>
<p>
        When only one YKUSH board is attached to the host the <b>[-s serial_number]</b> option is not required.
        Bellow are some examples.
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-bash">
#powerdown downstream port 1
$ ykushcmd ykush -d 1

#powerdown downstream port 2
$ ykushcmd ykush -d 2

#powerdown downstream port 3
$ ykushcmd ykush -d 3

#powerdown all three downstream ports
$ ykushcmd ykush -d a

#powerup downstream port 1
$ ykushcmd ykush -u 1

#powerup downstream port 2
$ ykushcmd ykush -u 2

#powerup downstream port 3
$ ykushcmd ykush -u 3

#powerup all three downstream ports
$ ykushcmd ykush -u a
</code>
</pre>

<p>
        If more than one YKUSH board is attached to the host the <b>[-s serial_number]</b> option should be used.
        Bellow are some examples.
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-bash">
#list the serial number for each of the attached YKUSH boards
$ ykushcmd ykush -l

Attached YKUSH Boards:
1. Board found with serial number: YK17125
2. Board found with serial number: YK21493

#powerdown downstream port 1 of the board with serial number YK17125
$ ykushcmd ykush -s YK17125 -d 1

#powerdown downstream port 1 of the board with serial number YK21493
$ ykushcmd ykush -s YK21493 -d 1

#powerdown downstream port 3
$ ykushcmd ykush -d 3

#powerdown all three downstream ports of the board with serial number YK21493
$ ykushcmd ykush -s YK21493 -d a
</code>
</pre>


<h2 id="switch_state_command_example">Port switching state</h2>
<p>
        The current switching state of each downstream port can be fetched from the YKUSH board using the <b>[-g 1|2|3]</b> option.
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-bash">
#State of downstream port 1
$ ykushcmd ykush -g 1

Downstream port 1 is ON

#powerdown downstream port 1
$ ykushcmd ykush -d 1

#State of downstream port 1
$ ykushcmd ykush -g 1

Downstream port 1 is OFF

#list the serial number for each of the attached YKUSH boards
$ ykushcmd ykush -l

Attached YKUSH Boards:
1. Board found with serial number: YK17125
2. Board found with serial number: YK21493

#State of downstream port 1 of the board with serial number YK17125
$ ykushcmd ykush -s YK17125 -g 1

Downstream port 1 is OFF

#powerup downstream port 1 of the board with serial number YK17125
$ ykushcmd ykush -s YK17125 -u 1
